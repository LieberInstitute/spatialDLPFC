This directory contains symbolic links to the FASTQ files for the 30 non-IF Visium samples. It was created because the original FASTQ filenames were misleading, sometimes either not containing a sample ID or containing the wrong one (due to sample ID swap issues). The new names will be used for upload to synapse, so that a user can directly relate a given FASTQ file back to its corresponding sample ID.
