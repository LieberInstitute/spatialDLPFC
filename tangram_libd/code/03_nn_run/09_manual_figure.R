#   The "main tangram deconvolution figure" (Fig 4a from the paper) is hard to
#   generate outside of squidpy, and requires cell centroid info, which doesn't
#   seem critically important to the value of the figure. Here I explore if we
#   can generate a similar figure that only requires cell counts per spot.
