## Overview

<img src="http://research.libd.org/spatialDLPFC/img/Br6255_ant_Sp09.png" align="left" width="300px" />

Welcome to the `spatialDLPFC` project! This project involves 3 data types as well as several interactive websites, all of which you are publicly accessible for you to browse and download.

In this project we studied spatially resolved and single nucleus transcriptomics data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from postmortem human brain samples. From 10 neurotypical controls we generated spatially-resolved transcriptomics data using using [10x Genomics **Visium**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression) across the anterior, middle, and posterior DLPFC (n = 30). We also generated single nucleus RNA-seq (**snRNA-seq**) data using [10x Genomics Chromium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-gene-expression) from 19 of these tissue blocks. We further generated data from 4 adjacent tissue slices with [10x Genomics **Visium Spatial Proteogenomics** (SPG)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-proteogenomics), that can be used to benchmark spot deconvolution algorithms. This work is being was performed by the [Keri Martinowich](https://www.libd.org/team/keri-martinowich-phd/), [Leonardo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/), and [Kristen Maynard](https://www.libd.org/team/kristen-maynard-phd/) teams at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](libd.org) as well as [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/)'s group from [JHBSPH's Biostatistics Department](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics).

This project involves the GitHub repositories [LieberInstitute/spatialDLPFC](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialDLPFC) and [LieberInstitute/DLPFC_snRNAseq](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/DLPFC_snRNAseq).

## Study Design

<img src="http://research.libd.org/spatialDLPFC/img/study_overview.png" width="600px" align="left" />

**Study design to generate paired single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatially-resolved transcriptomic data across DLPFC**. **A**. Tissue blocks were dissected across the rostral-caudal axis from 10 adult neurotypical control postmortem human brains of the DLPFC, including anterior (Ant), middle (Mid, and posterior (Post) positions (n=3 blocks per donor, n=30 blocks total). **B**. The same tissue blocks were used for snRNA-seq (10x Genomics 3â€™ gene expression assay, n=1-2 blocks per donor, n=19 samples) and spatial transcriptomics (10x Genomics Visium spatial gene expression assay, n=3 blocks per donor, n=30 samples). **C**. Tissue block orientation and morphology was confirmed by single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) for laminar marker genes with RNAscope (_SLC17A7_ marking excitatory neurons in pink, _MBP_ marking white matter in green, _RELN_ marking layer 1 in yellow, and _NR4A2_ marking layer 6 in orange) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Spotplots depicting log transformed normalized expression (logcounts) of _SNAP25_, _MBP_, and _PCP4_ in the Visium data confirm the presence of gray matter, white matter, and cortical layers, respectively.

If you are interested in running the [`spatialLIBD`](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08601-w) applications locally, you can do so thanks to the [`spatialLIBD::run_app()`](http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/reference/run_app.html), which you can also use with your own data as shown in our [vignette for publicly available datasets provided by 10x Genomics](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/spatialLIBD/inst/doc/TenX_data_download.html).

```{r run_app, eval = FALSE}
## Run this web application locally
spatialLIBD::run_app()
## You will have more control about the length of the
## session and memory usage.
## You could also use this function to visualize your
## own data given some requirements described
## in detail in the package vignette documentation
## at http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/.
```

All of these websites are powered by open source software, namely:

* [`spatialLIBD`](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08601-w)
* [`loopy`](https://github.com/chaichontat/loopy-browser) 
* [`iSEE`](https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.14966.1)

## Data Access

We highly value open data sharing and believe that doing so accelerates science, as was the case between our [`HumanPilot`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0) and the external [`BayesSpace`](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00935-2) projects, documented [on this slide](https://speakerdeck.com/lcolladotor/hca-la-2022?slide=18). We also value public questions, as they allow other users to learn from the answers. If you have any questions, please ask them on a public forum such as [LieberInstitute/spatialDLPFC/issues](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialDLPFC/issues).

### Processed Data

[`spatialLIBD`](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08601-w) also allows you to access the data from this project as ready to use R objects. That is, a:

* [`SpatialExperiment`](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac299) object for the Visium samples (n = 30)
* [`SpatialExperiment`](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac299) object for the Visium SPG samples (n = 4)
* [`SingleCellExperiment`](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0654-x) object for the snRNA-seq samples (n = 19)

You can use the [`zellkonverter`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/zellkonverter/) Bioconductor package to convert any of them into Python [`AnnData`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) objects. If you browse our code, you can find examples of such conversions.

If you are unfamiliar with these tools, you might want to check the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#.Y4hWlOzMJUM) (check and search keywords on the [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1is8dZSd0FZ9Qi1Zvq1uRhm-P1McnJRd_zxdAfCRoMfA/edit?usp=sharing)) videos and resources.

#### Installing spatialLIBD

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `spatialLIBD` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) with the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
## Install BiocManager in order to install Bioconductor packages properly
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

## Check that you have a valid R/Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()

## Now install spatialLIBD from Bioconductor
## (this version has been tested on macOS, winOS, linux)
BiocManager::install("spatialLIBD")

## If you need the development version from GitHub you can use the following:
# BiocManager::install("LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD")
## Note that this version might include changes that have not been tested
## properly on all operating systems.
```

### R objects

Using `spatialLIBD` you can access the spatialDLPFC
transcriptomics data from the 10x Genomics Visium platform. For example,
this is the code you can use to access the spatially-resolved data. For more
details, check the help file for `fetch_data()`.

### Raw data

You can access all the raw data through [Globus](http://research.libd.org/globus/) (`jhpce#spatialDLPFC` and `jhpce#DLPFC_snRNAseq`). This includes all the input FASTQ files as well as the outputs from tools such as [`SpaceRanger`](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-space-ranger) or [`CellRanger`](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger). The files are _mostly_ organized following the [LieberInstitute/template_project](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/template_project) project structure.
