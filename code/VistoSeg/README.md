Visium_IF was performed on 4 samples as a part of the spatialDLPFC study. This folder contains image pre-processing and processing steps performed for those samples. There are two subfolders here:

## 1. IF
internal:  /dcs04/lieber/lcolladotor/spatialDLPFC_LIBD4035/spatialDLPFC/code/VistoSeg/IF
Contains the scripts used to perform various image preprocessing and processing steps for the Visium_IF samples before performing downstream analysis. This folder contains MATLAB scripts from VistoSeg IF pipeline as well as  bash script (.sh) and .log files that were used to perform and store the output of various different processing steps.

## 2. code
internal: /dcs04/lieber/lcolladotor/spatialDLPFC_LIBD4035/spatialDLPFC/code/VistoSeg/code
Contains the scripts used to perform various image pre-processing and processing steps for Visium samples before performing downstream analysis. This folder contains MATLAB scripts from the VistoSeg pipeline and a Logs folder with the outputs of bash scripts in .txt format.
