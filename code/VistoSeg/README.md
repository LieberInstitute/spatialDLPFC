This directory contains documentation for VistoSeg folder


VistoSeg is a computational method to segment and count nuclei contained in each gene expression spot based on analyzing the histological H&E images as well as fluoroscent IF images. Visium_IF was performed on 4 samples as a part of this spatialDLPFC study. This directory contains scripts from VistoSeg pipeline.

Code:

Contains VistoSeg scripts used to perform various image preprocessing and processing steps for the Visium_IF samples before performing downstream analysis. This folder contains MATLAB scripts from VistoSeg pipeline as well as  bash script (.sh) and .log files that were used to perform and store the output of various different processing steps.

IF:

Contains VistoSeg-IF scripts used to perform various image pre-processing and processing steps for Visium samples before performing downstream analysis. This folder contains MATLAB scripts from the VistoSeg pipeline and a Logs folder with the outputs of bash scripts in .txt format.
