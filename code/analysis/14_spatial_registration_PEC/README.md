## Dataset Info  

**What assay to use?**

"Given the default operations in
Pegasus, we had to explicitly create a new matrix to store the raw count values: “raw_new” is
the name of the matrix containing the raw counts for each study, while the default “X” and
“raw.X” contain the log-normalized counts."

**What annotations to use?**

"The final annotations are contained under the “subclass” column"

Subclass with `make.names()` applied = `cellType`
