# Features

## Spot-deconvolution results

Spot deconvolution was performed with two software tools (`Tangram` and `Cell2location`) and at two cell-type resolutions (`broad` and `layer`). The total number of cells of a given cell type can be displayed by selecting the feature with this naming format:

`[cell-type resolution]_[software tool]_[cell type]`

For example, the feature `broad_cell2location_excit` shows the number of excitatory (a broad cell type) cells predicted by `Cell2location` in each spot.
