# Spatial DLPFC (U01)

This project has the code for the project using 10X Genomics Visium for generating spatial transcriptomics data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from human brain samples. This work is being done by the groups at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development led by Keri Martinowich, Kristen Maynard and Leonardo Collado-Torres as well as Stephanie Hicks from JHBSPH's Biostatistics Department.

## Files in git repository

- `scripts/`: Shell scripts to run Space Ranger; other Shell scripts
- `analysis/`: RMarkdown and/or R scripts for analyses

_Note: the idea is to use the same structure as in the [`locus-c`](https://github.com/lmweber/locus-c) project._
