------------- Normal dilation by 3 pixels:
Average number of nuclei covered per expanded mask: ~1.04
~4.0% masks have at least 2 nuclei.
~0.0% masks have no nuclei (dilation "ate" the nucleus)
Dilation-induced overlap of expanded masks resulted in ~97.2% of masks kept.

Average number of nuclei covered per expanded mask: ~1.04
~4.0% masks have at least 2 nuclei.
~0.0% masks have no nuclei (dilation "ate" the nucleus)
Dilation-induced overlap of expanded masks resulted in ~97.2% of masks kept.
